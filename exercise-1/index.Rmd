### Exercise 1 ###

library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)

# Store a variable "movie"

# Write a function that allows you to specify a movie, then does the following:
GetReview <- function(movie) {
    no.spaces <- gsub(" ", "+", movie)
  base <- c('https://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/reviews/search.json?')
  api.key <- '&api-key=92d8678280434732b5231a4c037f59c6'
  request <- paste0(base, "query=", no.spaces, api.key)
  movie.review <- fromJSON (request)
  flattened <- flatten(movie.review$results)
  
  recent.review <- flattened[1,]
  headline <- recent.review$headline
  summary <- recent.review$summary_short
  link <- recent.review$link.url
  info <- list(headline = headline, summary = summary, link = link)
  return (info)
  # Replace all of the spaces in your movie title with plus signs (+)
  
  
  # Construct a search query using YOUR api key
  # The base URL is https://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/reviews/search.json?
  # See the interactive console for more detail:https://developer.nytimes.com/movie_reviews_v2.json#/Console/GET/reviews/search.json
  
  
  
  # Request data using your search query
  
  
  # Flatten the data stored in the `$results` key of the data returned to you
  
  
  # From the most recent review, store the headline, short summary, and link to full article each in their own variables
  
  
  # Return an list of the three pieces of information from above
  
}

# Create a variable called `movie.info` by passing your movie to your GetReview function
movie.info <- GetReview('Forrest Gump')
```

This is so exciting. R is letting me make a website. WHOO.

# `r movie`
## `r movie.info$deadline`
Below is the summary about `r movie` from the New York Times API
> `r movie.info$summary`
